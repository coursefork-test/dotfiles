Installation:

git clone git://github.com/matthoffman/dotfiles.git  ~/src/

This will create a folder called ~/src/dotfiles, with folders named "bin" and 
"etc" inside it. Of course, you might want it somewhere different.  twerth, who
originated most of these files (git://github.com/twerth/dotfiles.git), puts his
in ~/cl/dotfiles.  Put them wherever you want, but grep the scripts for 
"src/dotfiles" -- it's called out explicitly in etc/bashrc when sourcing in 
other bashrc_* files, and could be in some other places. 


Create symlinks:

The "links" file in bin exists for this, but be very careful -- it 
is indiscriminately deletes existing files!  You may be more comfortable just
linking the files yourself.  See what the "links" script does, and manually
link those files that you care about.  For example: 

ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/etc/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/etc/vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/etc/vim ~/.vim
